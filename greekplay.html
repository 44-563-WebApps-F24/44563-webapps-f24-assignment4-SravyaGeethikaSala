            <p> Thou woman's minion! mince not terms with me,</p> 

            <P><strong>HAEM.</strong></P>
            <P>Wouldst thou have all the speaking on thy side?</P> 
            
            <P><strong>CR.</strong></P>
            <P>Is 't possible? By yon heaven! thou'lt not escape,</P>
            <p>For adding contumely to words of blame.</p>
            <p>Bring out the hated thing, that she may die</p>
            <p>Immediately, before her lover's face! </P> 
            
            <P><strong>HAEM.</strong></P>
            <P> Nay, dream not she shall suffer in my sight</P>
            <p>Nor shalt thou ever see my face again</p>
            <p>Let those stay with you that can brook your rage! </P>

            <P>My lord, he is parted swiftly in deep wrath!</P>
            <p>The youthful spirit offended makes wild work. </P> 
            
            <P><strong>CR.</strong></P>
            <p> Ay, let him do his worst. Let him give scope</p>
            <p>To pride beyond the compass of a man!</p>
            <p>He shall not free these maidens from their doom. </p> 
            
            <P><strong>CH.</strong></P>
            <P> Is death thy destination for them both?</P>
